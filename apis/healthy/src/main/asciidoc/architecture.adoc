== SPI Usage

Implementors of the API are expected to supply implementations of `HealthCheckResponse` and `HealthCheckResponseBuilder` by providing a `HealthCheckResponseProvider` to their implementation. The `HealthCheckResponseProvider` is discovered using the default JDK service loader.

A `HealthCheckResponseProvider` is used internally to create a `HealthCheckResponseBuilder` which is used to construct a `HealthCheckResponse`. This pattern allows implementors to extend a `HealthCheckResponse` and adapt it to their implementation needs. Common implementation details that fall into this category are invocation and security contexts or anything else required to map a `HealthCheckResponse` to the outermost invocation protocol (i.e. HTTP/JSON).
