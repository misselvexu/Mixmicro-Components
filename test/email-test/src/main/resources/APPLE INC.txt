3.  You acknowledge and agree that all use of the Apple Eligible Content is subject to the applicable license terms that govern the type of Apple Eligible Content being cached.  These terms may include, but are not limited to, the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, the iCloud Terms and Conditions, the iTunes U Instructor Agreement, the iTunes U Software License Agreement, and/or the applicable licensing terms that accompanied the software being downloaded, unless the download was accompanied by its own separate license agreement in which case the latter would apply.  A list of Apple Software License Agreements (SLAs) may be found here: https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/.  You acknowledge and agree that the use of the Content Caching Features and storage of Apple Eligible Content on your Mac Computer does not transfer to you any rights beyond those granted to you in the applicable license terms for the Apple Eligible Content and shall not constitute a grant, waiver, or other limitation of any rights of Apple or any other copyright owners in any Apple Eligible Content.
 
4.  You are not authorized to deploy your Mac Computer with the Content Caching Features enabled on a network you do not own or control (or which you are not legally authorized to use for such purposes), or to permit access to such Apple Eligible Content from end users outside of your home, company or organization.  You agree to only use the Content Caching Features for internal testing and evaluation purposes and solely for your own personal, non-commercial use or for internal use within your company or organization, and only as expressly permitted herein.  You may not provide a service to third parties that integrates with or leverages services or information provided by the Content Caching Features or uses the Content Caching Features in any way.

6.  Apple reserves the right to stop making Apple Eligible Content available for caching on your Mac Computer (e.g., some content that you may have previously cached may not be available for subsequent caching) and to remove any cached Apple Eligible Content from your Mac Computers at any time in its sole discretion, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event.  You understand that such caching of Apple Eligible Content may not be available in all countries or regions.  You may remove the cached Apple Eligible Content and disable the Content Caching Features at any time.

No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Apple is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the Services.

Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions
 
These Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions (the “Supplemental Terms”) supplement the Software License Agreement for Apple Confidential macOS Pre-Release Seed Software (the “License”); both the terms of the License and these Supplemental Terms govern your use of the Apple Pay feature, which shall be deemed a “Service” under the License.  Capitalized terms used in these Supplemental Terms have the meanings set forth in the License.
 1 Overview and Use Restrictions
 
Apple Pay allows you to store virtual representations of credit, debit and prepaid cards, including store credit, debit and prepaid cards, which are supported by the Apple Pay feature (“Supported Cards”) and use supported Macs to initiate or make payments within websites.  The Apple Pay features of the Apple Software may only be available in select regions, with select card issuers, and with select merchants. Features may vary by region, issuer, and merchant.  Supported Cards may change from time to time.
 
Apple Pay is intended for your personal use and you may only provision your own Supported Cards.  If you are provisioning a supported corporate card, you represent that you are doing so with the authorization of your employer and you are authorized to bind your employer to these terms of use and all transactions effected by use of this feature.
 
You agree not to use Apple Pay for illegal or fraudulent purposes, or any other purposes that are prohibited by the License and these Supplemental Terms.  You further agree to use Apple Pay in accordance with applicable law and regulation.  You agree not to interfere with or disrupt the Apple Pay service (including accessing the service through any automated means), or any servers or networks connected to the service, or any policies, requirements or regulations of networks connected to the service (including any unauthorized access to, use or monitoring of data or traffic thereon).
 
2 Use on Macs
 You can use Apple Pay on supported Macs to initiate payments on websites accessed through Safari.  This feature requires you to have a Supported Card that has been provisioned to a supported iOS device or Apple Watch (“Supported Devices”).  When you check out from a website using Apple Pay, you will be required to authorize the transaction using a Supported Device.
 
In addition to the terms set forth in these Supplemental Terms, your use of Apple Pay to initiate payments on websites access through Safari is subject to the Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions applicable to your Supported Devices, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference and which can be accessed by going to:  Settings > General > About > Legal > License from your iOS device, or About > Legal > License from the Watch app on a paired iOS device.  Supported Devices may change from time to time.  
 
On a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, you can set up Apple Pay by provisioning Supported Cards and using Apple Pay to make payments on websites accessed through Safari.  In order to use Apple Pay on these Macs, you must have Supported Cards that are associated with an active iCloud account.  Apple Pay is available only to individuals aged 13 years or older, and may be subject to additional age-based restrictions imposed by iCloud or the relevant card issuer of your Supported Cards. 
 
3 Apple’s Relationship With You
 Apple does not process payments, or have any other control over payments, returns, refunds, rewards, value, discounts or other commerce activity that may arise out of your use of this feature.  The terms of cardholder agreements you may have in place with your card issuer will continue to govern your use of your Supported Cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay.  Similarly, your purchase of any goods or services using the Apple Pay feature will be subject to the merchant’s terms and conditions.  Nothing in the License or these Supplemental Terms modifies the terms of any cardholder or merchant agreement, and such terms will govern your use of the applicable Supported Card and its virtual representation on your supported Mac.
 You agree that Apple is not a party to your cardholder or merchant agreements, nor is Apple responsible for the (a) content, accuracy or unavailability of any payment cards, commerce activities, transactions or purchases while using Apple Pay functionality; (b) issuance of credit or assessing eligibility for credit; (c) accrual or redemption of rewards or stored value under a merchant’s program; or (d) funding or reloading of prepaid cards.  For all disputes or questions about payment cards or associated commerce activity, please contact your issuer or the applicable merchant.
 
4 Privacy
 When using Apple Pay to initiate a payment transaction to be completed on a Supported Device, Apple Pay will transfer payment information in an encrypted format between your Mac and your Supported Device to complete your transaction. When using Apple Pay to make a payment transaction on a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, your payment information will be provided in encrypted format to the website as part of that transaction. When adding a card to Apple Pay on a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, information about your device, such as whether certain device settings are enabled and device use patterns (e.g. percent time device is in motion, approximate number of calls per week), will be sent to Apple to determine your eligibility and to prevent fraud. You can find more information on the data collected, used or shared as part of your use of Apple Pay by reading About Apple Pay and Privacy (which can be accessed by going to Wallet & Apple Pay on your iOS device or Mac, or within the Watch app on a paired iOS device).  You can learn more about how Apple protects your personal information by reviewing our Privacy Policy at https://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/. By using Apple Pay, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all of the foregoing information, to provide Apple Pay functionality.
 
5 Security
 Apple Pay stores virtual representations of your Supported Cards, and you understand and acknowledge that providing your device passcode or password to a third party, or allowing a third party to add their fingerprint to use Touch ID on your Supported Device or Mac, may result in their ability to make Apple Pay payments within websites on your Mac.   You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your devices and the applicable passcodes and passwords.  You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you lose or share access to your device, or if you make unauthorized modifications to macOS.
 
If your device is lost or stolen and you have Find My iPhone or Find My Mac enabled, you can use Find iPhone or icloud.com to attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on the device by putting it into Lost Mode. You can also erase your device, which will attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on the device. You should also contact the card issuer of your Supported Cards in order to prevent unauthorized access to your virtual Supported Cards.
 If you report or Apple suspects fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with Apple in any investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe.
 
6 Limitation of Liability
 
IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE LICENSE, APPLE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR PURCHASES, PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHER COMMERCE ACTIVITY MADE USING THE APPLE PAY FEATURE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO AGREEMENTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH YOUR CARD ISSUER, PAYMENT NETWORK, OR MERCHANT TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES RELATING TO YOUR SUPPORTED CARDS, VIRTUAL SUPPORTED CARDS AND ASSOCIATED COMMERCE ACTIVITY.
